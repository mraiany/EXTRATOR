# Pin to a non-yanked version of undetected-chromedriver. Version 3.3.1 was
# yanked from PyPI and causes build failures. The latest available version
# as of Feb 17, 2024 is 3.5.5:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}, which is compatible with
# Selenium 4.9+:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}. This pin restores installability.
